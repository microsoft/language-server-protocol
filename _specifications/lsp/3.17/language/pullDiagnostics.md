#### <a href="#textDocument_pullDiagnostics" name="textDocument_pullDiagnostics" class="anchor">Pull Diagnostics</a>

Diagnostics are currently published by the server to the client using a notification. This model has the advantage that for workspace wide diagnostics the server has the freedom to compute them at a server preferred point in time. On the other hand the approach has the disadvantage that the server can't prioritize the computation for the file in which the user types or which are visible in the editor. Inferring the client's UI state from the `textDocument/didOpen` and `textDocument/didChange` notifications might lead to false positives since these notifications are ownership transfer notifications.

The specification therefore introduces the concept of diagnostic pull requests to give a client more control over the documents for which diagnostics should be computed and at which point in time.

_Client Capability_:
* property name (optional): `textDocument.diagnostic`
* property type: `DiagnosticClientCapabilities` defined as follows:

	 * `true` the client supports the new
	 * `(TextDocumentRegistrationOptions & StaticRegistrationOptions)`
	 * return value for the corresponding server capability as well.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Whether the clients supports related documents for document diagnostic
	 * pulls.
	 */
	relatedDocumentSupport?: boolean;

_Server Capability_:

	StaticRegistrationOptions {
}
```

##### <a href="#textDocument_diagnostic" name="textDocument_diagnostic" class="anchor">Document Diagnostics(:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

The text document diagnostic request is sent from the client to the server to ask the server to compute the diagnostics for a given document. As with other pull requests the server is asked to compute the diagnostics for the currently synced version of the document.

_Request_:
* method: 'textDocument/diagnostic'.
* params: `DocumentDiagnosticParams` defined as follows:

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#documentDiagnosticParams" name="documentDiagnosticParams" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface DocumentDiagnosticParams extends WorkDoneProgressParams,
	PartialResultParams {
	/**
	 * The text document.
	 */
	textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;

	/**
	 * The additional identifier  provided during registration.
	 */
	identifier?: string;

	/**
	 * The result id of a previous response if provided.
	 */
	previousResultId?: string;
}
```

_Response_:
* result: `DocumentDiagnosticReport` defined as follows:

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#documentDiagnosticReport" name="documentDiagnosticReport" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**

}
```

##### <a href="#workspace_diagnostic" name="workspace_diagnostic" class="anchor">Workspace Diagnostics(:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

The workspace diagnostic request is sent from the client to the server to ask the server to compute workspace wide diagnostics which previously where pushed from the server to the client. In contrast to the document diagnostic request the workspace request can be long running and is not bound to a specific workspace or document state. If the client supports streaming for the workspace diagnostic pull it is legal to provide a document diagnostic report multiple times for the same document URI. The last one reported will win over previous reports.

If a client receives a diagnostic report for a document in a workspace diagnostic request for which the client also issues individual document diagnostic pull requests the client needs to decide which diagnostics win and should be presented. In general:

- diagnostics for a higher document version should win over those from a lower document version (e.g. note that document versions are steadily increasing)
- diagnostics from a document pull should win over diagnostics from a workspace pull.

_Request_:
* method: 'workspace/diagnostic'.
* params: `WorkspaceDiagnosticParams` defined as follows:

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#workspaceDiagnosticParams" name="workspaceDiagnosticParams" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

##### <a href="#diagnostic_refresh" name="diagnostic_refresh" class="anchor">Diagnostics Refresh(:arrow_right_hook:)</a>

The `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` request is sent from the server to the client. Servers can use it to ask clients to refresh all needed document and workspace diagnostics. This is useful if a server detects a project wide configuration change which requires a re-calculation of all diagnostics.

_Request_:
* method: `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`
* params: none

_Response_:

* result: void
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the 'workspace/diagnostic/refresh' request


##### Implementation Considerations

Generally the language server specification doesn't enforce any specific client implementation since those usually depend on how the client UI behaves. However since diagnostics can be provided on a document and workspace level here are some tips:

- a client should pull actively for the document the users types in.
- if the server signals inter file dependencies a client should also pull for visible documents to ensure accurate diagnostics. However the pull should happen less frequently.
- if the server signals workspace pull support a client should also pull for workspace diagnostics. It is recommended for clients to implement partial result progress for the workspace pull to allow servers to keep the request open for a long time. If a server closes a workspace diagnostic pull request the client should re-trigger the request.
