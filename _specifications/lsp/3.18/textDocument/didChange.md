#### <a href="#textDocument_didChange" name="textDocument_didChange" class="anchor">DidChangeTextDocument Notification (:arrow_right:)</a>

The document change notification is sent from the client to the server to signal changes to a text document. Before a client can change a text document it must claim ownership of its content using the `textDocument/didOpen` notification. In 2.0 the shape of the params has changed to include proper version numbers.

Before requesting information from the server (e.g., `textDocument/completion` or `textDocument/signatureHelp`), the client must ensure that the document's state is synchronized with the server to guarantee reliable results.

The following example shows how the client should synchronize the state when the user has continuous input, assuming user input triggered `textDocument/completion`:

| Document Version | User Input          | Client Behavior                                 | Request                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 5                | document change one | sync document `v5` to the server                | `textDocument/didChange`  |
| 5                | -                   | request from the server, based on document `v5` | `textDocument/completion` |
| 6                | document change two | sync document `v6` to the server                | `textDocument/didChange`  |

_Client Capability_:
See general synchronization [client capabilities](#textDocument_synchronization_cc).

_Server Capability_:
See general synchronization [server capabilities](#textDocument_synchronization_sc).

_Registration Options_: `TextDocumentChangeRegistrationOptions` defined as follows:

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#textDocumentChangeRegistrationOptions" name="textDocumentChangeRegistrationOptions" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * Describe options to be used when registering for text document change events.
 */
export interface TextDocumentChangeRegistrationOptions
	extends TextDocumentRegistrationOptions {
	/**
	 * How documents are synced to the server. See TextDocumentSyncKind.Full
	 * and TextDocumentSyncKind.Incremental.
	 */
	syncKind: TextDocumentSyncKind;
}
```

_Notification_:
* method: `textDocument/didChange`
* params: `DidChangeTextDocumentParams` defined as follows:

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#didChangeTextDocumentParams" name="didChangeTextDocumentParams" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
interface DidChangeTextDocumentParams {
	/**
	 * The document that did change. The version number points
	 * to the version after all provided content changes have
	 * been applied.
	 */
	textDocument: VersionedTextDocumentIdentifier;

	/**
	 * The actual content changes. The content changes describe single state
	 * changes to the document. So if there are two content changes c1 (at
	 * array index 0) and c2 (at array index 1) for a document in state S then
	 * c1 moves the document from S to S' and c2 from S' to S''. So c1 is
	 * computed on the state S and c2 is computed on the state S'.
	 *
	 * To mirror the content of a document using change events use the following
	 * approach:
	 * - start with the same initial content
	 * - apply the 'textDocument/didChange' notifications in the order you
	 *   receive them.
	 * - apply the `TextDocumentContentChangeEvent`s in a single notification
	 *   in the order you receive them.
	 */
	contentChanges: TextDocumentContentChangeEvent[];
}
```

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#textDocumentContentChangeEvent" name="textDocumentContentChangeEvent" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * An event describing a change to a text document. If only a text is provided
 * it is considered to be the full content of the document.
 */
export type TextDocumentContentChangeEvent = {
	/**
	 * The range of the document that changed.
	 */
	range: Range;

	/**
	 * The optional length of the range that got replaced.
	 *
	 * @deprecated use range instead.
	 */
	rangeLength?: uinteger;

	/**
	 * The new text for the provided range.
	 */
	text: string;
} | {
	/**
	 * The new text of the whole document.
	 */
	text: string;
};
```
