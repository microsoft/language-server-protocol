#### <a href="#textDocument_completion" name="textDocument_completion" class="anchor">Completion Request (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

The Completion request is sent from the client to the server to compute completion items at a given cursor position. Completion items are presented in the [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) user interface. If computing full completion items is expensive, servers can additionally provide a handler for the completion item resolve request ('completionItem/resolve'). This request is sent when a completion item is selected in the user interface. A typical use case for this would be the `textDocument/completion` request, which doesn't fill in the `documentation` property for returned completion items since it is expensive to compute. When the item is selected in the user interface, a 'completionItem/resolve' request is sent with the selected completion item as a parameter. The returned completion item should have the documentation property filled in. By default, the request can only delay the computation of the `detail` and `documentation` properties. Since 3.16.0, the client
can signal that it can resolve more properties lazily. This is done using the `completionItem#resolveSupport` client capability which lists all properties that can be filled in during a 'completionItem/resolve' request. All other properties (usually `sortText`, `filterText`, `insertText` and `textEdit`) must be provided in the `textDocument/completion` response and must not be changed during resolve.

The language server protocol uses the following model around completions:

- to achieve consistency across languages and to honor different clients, usually the client is responsible for filtering and sorting. This also has the advantage that clients can experiment with different filter and sorting models. However, servers can enforce different behavior by setting a `filterText` / `sortText`.
- for speed, clients should be able to filter an already received completion list if the user continues typing. Servers can opt out of this using a `CompletionList` and mark it as `isIncomplete`.

A completion item provides additional means to influence filtering and sorting. They are expressed by either creating a `CompletionItem` with an `insertText` or with a `textEdit`. The two modes differ as follows:

- **Completion item provides an insertText / label without a text edit**: in the model the client should filter against what the user has already typed using the word boundary rules of the language (e.g. resolving the word under the cursor position). The reason for this mode is that it makes it extremely easy for a server to implement a basic completion list and get it filtered on the client.

- **Completion Item with text edits**: in this mode the server tells the client that it actually knows what it is doing. If you create a completion item with a text edit at the current cursor position no word guessing takes place and no filtering should happen. This mode can be combined with a sort text and filter text to customize two things. If the text edit is a replace edit then the range denotes the word used for filtering. If the replace changes the text it most likely makes sense to specify a filter text to be used.

Completion items support snippets (see `InsertTextFormat.Snippet`). The snippet format is as follows:

##### <a href="#snippet_syntax" name="snippet_syntax" class="anchor">Snippet Syntax</a>

The `body` of a snippet can use special constructs to control cursors and the text being inserted. The following are supported features and their syntaxes:

##### Tab stops

With tab stops, you can make the editor cursor move inside a snippet. Use `$1`, `$2`, and so on to specify cursor locations. The number is the order in which tab stops will be visited, whereas `$0` denotes the final cursor position. Multiple tab stops are linked and updated in sync.

##### Placeholders

Placeholders are tab stops with values, like `${1:foo}`. The placeholder text will be inserted and selected such that it can be easily changed. Placeholders can be nested, like `${1:another ${2:placeholder}}`.

##### Choice

Placeholders can have choices as values. The syntax is a comma separated enumeration of values, enclosed with the pipe-character, for example `${1|one,two,three|}`. When the snippet is inserted and the placeholder selected, choices will prompt the user to pick one of the values.

##### Variables

With `$name` or `${name:default}` you can insert the value of a variable. When a variable isn’t set, its *default* or the empty string is inserted. When a variable is unknown (that is, its name isn’t defined) the name of the variable is inserted and it is transformed into a placeholder.

The following variables can be used:

* `TM_SELECTED_TEXT` The currently selected text or the empty string
* `TM_CURRENT_LINE` The contents of the current line
* `TM_CURRENT_WORD` The contents of the word under the cursor or the empty string
* `TM_LINE_INDEX` The zero-index based line number
* `TM_LINE_NUMBER` The one-index based line number
* `TM_FILENAME` The filename of the current document
* `TM_FILENAME_BASE` The filename of the current document without its extensions
* `TM_DIRECTORY` The directory of the current document
* `TM_FILEPATH` The full file path of the current document

##### Variable Transforms

Transformations allow you to modify the value of a variable before it is inserted. The definition of a transformation consists of three parts:

1. A [regular expression](#regExp) that is matched against the value of a variable, or the empty string when the variable cannot be resolved.
2. A "format string" that allows referencing matching groups from the regular expression. The format string allows for conditional inserts and simple modifications.
3. Options that are passed to the regular expression.

The following example inserts the name of the current file without its ending, so it transforms `foo.txt` to `foo`.

```
${TM_FILENAME/(.*)\..+$/$1/}
  |           |         | |
  |           |         | |-> no options
  |           |         |
  |           |         |-> references the contents of the first
  |           |             capture group
  |           |
  |           |-> regex to capture everything before
  |               the final `.suffix`
  |
  |-> resolves to the filename
```

##### Grammar

Below is the grammar for snippets in EBNF ([extended Backus-Naur form, XML variant](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-notation)). With `\` (backslash), you can escape `$`, `}` and `\`. Within choice elements, the backslash also escapes comma and pipe characters. Only the characters required to be escaped can be escaped, so `$` should not be escaped within these constructs and neither `$` nor `}` should be escaped inside choice constructs.

```
any         ::= tabstop | placeholder | choice | variable | text
tabstop     ::= '$' int | '${' int '}'
placeholder ::= '${' int ':' any '}'
choice      ::= '${' int '|' choicetext (',' choicetext)* '|}'
variable    ::= '$' var | '${' var }'
                | '${' var ':' any '}'
                | '${' var '/' regex '/' (format | formattext)* '/' options '}'
format      ::= '$' int | '${' int '}'
                /* Transforms the text to be uppercase, lowercase, or capitalized, respectively. */
                | '${' int ':' ('/upcase' | '/downcase' | '/capitalize') '}'
                /* Inserts the 'ifOnly' text if the match is non-empty. */
                | '${' int ':+' ifOnly '}'
                /* Inserts the 'if' text if the match is non-empty,
                   otherwise the 'else' text will be inserted. */
                | '${' int ':?' if ':' else '}'
                /* Inserts the 'else' text if the match is empty. */
                | '${' int ':-' else '}' | '${' int ':' else '}'
regex       ::= Regular Expression value (ctor-string)
options     ::= Regular Expression option (ctor-options)
var         ::= [_a-zA-Z] [_a-zA-Z0-9]*
int         ::= [0-9]+
text        ::= ([^$}\] | '\$' | '\}' | '\\')*
choicetext  ::= ([^,|\] | '\,' | '\|' | '\\')*
formattext  ::= ([^$/\] | '\$' | '\/' | '\\')*
ifOnly      ::= text
if          ::= ([^:\] | '\:' | '\\')*
else        ::= text
```

#### <a href="#completionItem_resolve" name="completionItem_resolve" class="anchor">Completion Item Resolve Request (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

The request is sent from the client to the server to resolve additional information for a given completion item.

_Request_:
* method: `completionItem/resolve`
* params: `CompletionItem`

_Response_:
* result: `CompletionItem`
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the completion resolve request.
