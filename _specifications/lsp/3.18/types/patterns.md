Pattern definitions used in file watchers and document filters.

```typescript
/**
 * The pattern to watch relative to the base path. Glob patterns can have
 * the following syntax:
 * - `*` to match one or more characters in a path segment
 * - `?` to match on one character in a path segment
 * - `**` to match any number of path segments, including none
 * - `{}` to group conditions (e.g. `**​/*.{ts,js}` matches all TypeScript
 *   and JavaScript files)
 * - `[]` to declare a range of characters to match in a path segment
 *   (e.g., `example.[0-9]` to match on `example.0`, `example.1`, …)
 * - `[!...]` to negate a range of characters to match in a path segment
 *   (e.g., `example.[!0-9]` to match on `example.a`, `example.b`,
 *   but not `example.0`)
