#### <a href="#initialize" name="initialize" class="anchor">Initialize Request (:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:)</a>

The initialize request is sent as the first request from the client to the server. If the server receives a request or notification before the `initialize` request, it should act as follows:

* For a request, the response should be an error with `code: -32002`. The message can be picked by the server.
* Notifications should be dropped, except for the exit notification. This will allow the exit of a server without an initialize request.

Until the server has responded to the `initialize` request with an `InitializeResult`, the client must not send any additional requests or notifications to the server. In addition the server is not allowed to send any requests or notifications to the client until it has responded with an `InitializeResult`, with the exception that during the `initialize` request the server is allowed to send the notifications `window/showMessage`, `window/logMessage` and `telemetry/event` as well as the `window/showMessageRequest` request to the client. In case the client sets up a progress token in the initialize params (e.g. property `workDoneToken`) the server is also allowed to use that token (and only that token) using the `$/progress` notification sent from the server to the client.

The `initialize` request may only be sent once.

##### NotebookDocumentClientCapabilities

`NotebookDocumentClientCapabilities` define capabilities the editor / tool provides on notebook documents.

<div class="anchorHolder"><a href="#notebookDocumentClientCapabilities" name="notebookDocumentClientCapabilities" class="linkableAnchor"></a></div>

```typescript
/**
 * Capabilities specific to the notebook document support.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface NotebookDocumentClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Capabilities specific to notebook document synchronization
	 *
	 * @since 3.17.0
	 */
	synchronization: NotebookDocumentSyncClientCapabilities;
}
```


`ClientCapabilities` define capabilities for dynamic registration, workspace and text document features the client supports. The `experimental` can be used to pass experimental capabilities under development. For future compatibility a `ClientCapabilities` object literal can have more properties set than currently defined. Servers receiving a `ClientCapabilities` object literal with unknown properties should ignore these properties. A missing property should be interpreted as an absence of the capability. If a missing property normally defines sub properties, all missing sub properties should be interpreted as an absence of the corresponding capability.

Client capabilities got introduced with version 3.0 of the protocol. They therefore only describe capabilities that got introduced in 3.x or later. Capabilities that existed in the 2.x version of the protocol are still mandatory for clients. Clients cannot opt out of providing them. So even if a client omits the `ClientCapabilities.textDocument.synchronization` it is still required that the client provides text document synchronization (e.g. open, changed and close notifications).
